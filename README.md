# webGL-Water

A WebGL-based project that simulates realistic water effects in a 3D environment. This project demonstrates the use of shaders, physics, and rendering techniques to create interactive and visually appealing water simulations.

technologies used:

HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling the page, including fonts, layout, and responsive design.
JavaScript: For implementing the logic and interactivity of the WebGL water simulation.
WebGL: For rendering 3D graphics and creating the water simulation.
GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language): For writing vertex and fragment shaders used in WebGL.
Canvas API: For creating and manipulating the WebGL rendering context.
LightGL.js: A lightweight WebGL library used for simplifying WebGL operations.
Cubemaps: For rendering the skybox and reflections.
Textures: For applying images and procedural textures to 3D objects.
Floating-Point Textures: For high-precision texture data in the water simulation.
OES Extensions: WebGL extensions like OES_texture_float, OES_texture_float_linear, and OES_standard_derivatives for advanced rendering features.
Event Handling: For mouse and touch interactions with the simulation.
Responsive Design: Using CSS media queries and JavaScript to adapt the canvas size to the viewport.
Matrix and Vector Math: For 3D transformations and physics calculations.
Physics Simulation: For simulating gravity and sphere interactions with the water surface.
Procedural Graphics: For generating caustics and other visual effects dynamically.
Cubemap Rotation: For rotating the skybox using keyboard inputs.
Dynamic Texture Updates: For updating water textures during the simulation.
These technologies work together to create an interactive and visually rich WebGL-based water simulation.
