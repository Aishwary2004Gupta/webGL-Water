# webGL-Water

A WebGL-based project that simulates realistic water effects in a 3D environment. This project demonstrates the use of shaders, physics, and rendering techniques to create interactive and visually appealing water simulations.

## Features
- Realistic water rendering using WebGL.
- Interactive controls to manipulate water properties.
- Lightweight and optimized for performance.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/webGL-Water.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd webGL-Water
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the simulation.

## Usage
- Use the on-screen controls to adjust water properties such as wave height, speed, and reflection.
- Interact with the water surface using your mouse or touch input.
